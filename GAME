let's say there are 2 games, pong, galaga, cityville.
they need to have some things in common.

1. they have an interface for the user.
every once in a while, the playerbot receives information
from the game. the playerbot decides wha to do based on the info.
the playerbot then sends information back to the game.
such interaction should be as general as possible.
2. people also need to see what's going on.
3. before game starts, you load scripts for all the bots in the game.
4. the game can be paused. people can inspect it.
5. the game ends.
6. the game starts.

7. basically a whole bunch of machines running.
8. machines maintain a connection with the "environment"
