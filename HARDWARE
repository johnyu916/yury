=== javascript simulation ===

can do parallel operaitons.


two ways so far:

1. 00 is the "no input" state. 01 and 10 are signals. after every computation, remember the signal and propagate 00 before sending again.
    problem: no way to remember what the previous state was.

2. first digit is cycle, second digit is signal.
