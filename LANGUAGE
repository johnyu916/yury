Goal: transparency, simplicity

The user should know exactly what is going on at all times.

3 instructions:
write value at some location.
if something, go here, else go there.

functions: labels for line numbers

function is just namespace. variables are named with slashes
like dictionaries.

write 0 to 100000.
if 100000 equals 1, go to 1000, else go to 500.

write 0-128 to bob
